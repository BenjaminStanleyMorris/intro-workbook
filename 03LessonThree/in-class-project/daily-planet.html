                <h3>Olympics</h3>
                <p>

                    Good morning on this murky Monday. You can stop the Olympic Games from coming to New York. But you can’t stop New York from going to the Olympic Games. Although our city has never hosted them — the 1932 and 1980 competitions in Lake Placid, N.Y., were
                    the closest we’ve come — we’ll no doubt be well represented at Rio 2016, which begins on Friday. A sizable portion of Team U.S.A. is from the New York area.</p>
                <p>
                    The basketball players Carmelo Anthony and Sue Bird are New Yorkers through and through: Mr. Anthony was born and raised in Brooklyn (before moving to Baltimore), and Ms. Bird in Syosset on Long Island. The Empire State can also lay claim to the swimming
                    star Ryan Lochte, born in Rochester, and the supersprinter Justin Gatlin, born in Brooklyn. New Yorkers have also mastered some of the lesser-known sports that we’ll see in Rio de Janeiro.
